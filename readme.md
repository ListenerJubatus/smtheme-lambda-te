Introduction
-----------
Lambda -Tournament Edition- is a fork of FiftyOne (though it may eventually succeed FiftyOne). Consider it the directors' cut, in a way. It's called the tournament edition because I was originally trying to offer it as an alternative to Simply Love when the UPS2 tournament originally proposed using a 5.1 build (however, it has since been reverted back to 5.0.12 due to issues in getting things working, and a lack of interest in 5.1 among content creators in general due to its higher learning curve). As such, it is designed to have some similarities to In the Groove. 

It also backtracks on some of FiftyOne's design conventions and choices to make it more robust and familiar; among them, I went back to a 480p resolution to improve backwards compatibility with content.

If this turns out better, my eventual goal is to apply the aesthetics of FiftyOne to Lambda as a rebooted successor to it.
